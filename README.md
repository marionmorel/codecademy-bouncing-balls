# Bouncing Balls

## Codecademy Project

Circles are powerful and expressive shapes.

Imagine a sketch with only one gray circle, small and tucked away in the corner. What mood would this convey? Isolation or shyness, perhaps. Now picture a ginormous, yellow circle in the very center of the image. This would express happiness or maybe remind us of the sun. If we then add animation to both circles, our shape will more fully embody the emotion we want it to express. To better communicate shyness, we could have the small gray ball moving out of the canvas frame slowly, as if it were hiding. For the yellow circle, we can animate it to pulse quickly, so it looks like it’s alive!

Our single white-on-black bouncing ball from the Animation lesson was on the sad side. It was not taking up too much space, there was no color, and the pace remained the same. So let’s add some life to our bouncing ball! Together, we will give our circle some vitality and some friends of many colors and sizes! Using arrays and the p5.js animation techniques we just covered, we will change our bouncing ball’s personality from boring to dynamic!
